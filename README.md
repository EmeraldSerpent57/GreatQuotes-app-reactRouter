# Multipage Quote App with React Router v5

### Things I would like to add to this app:
1. Cleaner homepage where you will click a link to see all the quotes, instead of them being displayed right away
  - "Great Quotes" Header at top of page will be clickable to go back to main homepage
  - add metadata to this!
  
2. show modal after quote is added 
  -need to work on styling!
  
4. Uploaded by info will be shown on a seperate page with a link to access at the bottom of page
  - small link at bottom right of page that says "Quotes contributed by"
  
6. Sort feature to add a alphabetically option
  - make sorting option a drop down

8. Show how many comments have been made on all quotes page

9. comments should automatically load when you go to the "view fullscreen page", get rid of "load comments" button



Deploy this app for production (https://multipage-quote-app-fdaaa.web.app)

## App uses the following: 
- React Router v5
- React-Helmet
- FireBase
- Jest
- NodeJS
