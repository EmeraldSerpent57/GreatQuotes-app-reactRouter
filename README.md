# Multipage Quote App with React Router v5

### Things I would like to add to this app:
1. Cleaner homepage where you will click a link to see all the quotes, instead of them being displayed right away
  - "Great Quotes" Header at top of page will be clickable to go back to main homepage
  
2. Clear text field after a quote is added and show modal that will either take you back to the quotes page or stay on the add page. 
  - modal says "Thank you for your contribution, your quote has been added"
  
3. Option to add an "submitted by" field where others who have uploaded quotes can log their contribution 
  - contribution to show a username that they add themselves
  
4. Uploaded by info will be shown on a seperate page with a link to access at the bottom of page
  - small link at bottom right of page that says "Quotes contributed by"
  
5. Sort feature to be changed to "newest" and "oldest"
6. Sort feature to add a alphabetically option
  - make sorting option a drop down
  
7. Make sure we add metadata to the head and title for the website

8. Show how many comments have been made on all quotes page

9. Comment field to be cleared when you submit your comment 
  - comments should automatically load when you go to the "view fullscreen page", get rid of "load comments" button



Deploy this app for production (https://multipage-quote-app-fdaaa.web.app)
