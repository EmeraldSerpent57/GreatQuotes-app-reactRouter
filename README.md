# Multipage Quote App with React Router v5

### Things I would like to add to this app:
1. Cleaner homepage where you will click a link to see all the quotes, instead of them being displayed right away
2. Clear text field after a comment is made
3. Option to add an "uploaded by" field where others who have uploaded quotes can log their contribution
4. Uploaded by info will be shown on a seperate page with a link to access at the bottom of page
5. Deploy this app for production
